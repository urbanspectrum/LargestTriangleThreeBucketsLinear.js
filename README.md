Largest Triangle Three Buckets for linear array of data minified

Original code 2013 by Sveinn Steinarsson

LTTB (Largest Triangle Three Buckets) is a downsampling algorithm described by Sveinn Steinarsson in his Master thesis that decimates your data while keeping its visual aspect.

This minified javascript is modified for linear data arrays 

var signal  = [-93,-258,-79,135,125,-141,-298,-68,238  ....];

Usage:
lttbArray = lttb(signal, 5000);

5000 is the length of the returned array.
